> > Pagination is a technique used in web development to break up large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that would take a long time to load or display all at once. Pagination can also be used to improve the performance of a website by reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded at any given time.
